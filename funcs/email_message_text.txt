Thank you for participating in our workforce survey about community member job skills, experiences, and interests. Your inputs will be extremely important as we seek to understand the employment strengths and desires of people from across the state, to make informed recommendations to workforce decision makers about how to improve access to employment for ALL Delawareans. 

As promised, below are the results from the skills assessment portion of the survey. We have included recommendations of careers that you are well-suited for, based on your responses. You can click on each career to learn more! 

We also wanted to share this informational flyer with important links to different workforce agencies and resources that may be useful to you in the future.

Finally, we will be sending you your $10 gift card for participating in the coming daysâ€¦ look out for it in your inbox (and check your junk mail if you don't receive it in the next 10 days)! Please respond to this email if you have any additional questions. 

Thank you again for your contributions to our work. 

Take care,

Team Work4Success
